This application is designed to let users search for content within a specified date range and depth (articles that can be found by clicking on links within the single page) and generate a text file with all of the articles' content. From here we will allow the users to run analytical functions, such as displaying how many times certain words occur, words that often precede or follow certain words, and other analytics functions. For example, if the user were to search for articles in the past year that contain "Hillary Clinton", this tool would allow the user to identify context and frequency for her name appearing.
